            <p> a recent graduate and tech enthusiast driven by curiosity and a love for building thoughtful digital experiences. I enjoy learning through hands-on projects and stay sharp by exploring new tools and sharpening my language skills on Duolingo. I’m excited to grow, collaborate, and create things that make a difference.
                Short, sharp, and still has your vibe. Want it even punchier for a LinkedIn header or résumé summary? I can trim further or reshape it however you need.
            </p>
